/*
 * Pseudo
 * ----------
 * This program will prompt the user if they're ready to workout, this is the beginning of "motivation" and it becomes my boolean value. Once that is complete, I will proceed to get
 * information through prompts and confirms. These include the time, name, how long they have until they have to be somewhere (instead of just limiting this to work hours).
 *
 * My JSON data will be in a seperate .js file this file will have some workouts in them. These will be pulled out and then used
 *  "indoorWorkouts" :[{
 *      "Jumping Jacks" : 40,
 *      "Push Ups" : 100,
 *      "Leg Lifts" : 50
 *  }]
 *
 *  "gymWorkouts" :[{
 *      "Pull Ups" : 40,
 *      "Curls" : 40,
 *      "Bench Press" : 50
 *  }]
 *
 * Math:
 * My Math will be the math of how many hours they have to work out until they have to be somewhere.
 *
 * Array:
 * 
 * My array method will be indexOf() as I search the array for a certain piece of information
