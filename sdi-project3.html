<p>My Program is to being motivating and give you a workout based on the amount of time you have remaining until you have to be at a certain location. This uses many loops to cycle through the times and the arrays and JSON data. I ended up having an issue with the array printing/modification to where it was happening too much.</p>
<p>This project definitely proved challenging. Due to time contraints I am not entirely pleased with this outcome. I'm not sure if it's due to me trying to make it too difficult or it just was that difficult.</p>
